## 🚀 Final Step: Configure Cline

### Option 1: Copy Configuration (Recommended)

1. **Copy the configuration** from `MCP/cline-mcp-config.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "robot-team": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["C:/Projects/robot-team/MCP/robot-team-server/robot-team-server/build/index.js"],
         "env": {
           "ROBOT_TEAM_API_KEY": "rtk_6f9ec826eb6d4085864648a6d58dce2a",
           "ROBOT_TEAM_API_URL": "http://localhost:9000"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Add to Cline MCP Settings:**
   - In VS Code: Command Palette → "Cline: Open MCP Settings"
   - Or edit your MCP configuration file directly
   - Paste the configuration above

3. **Restart Cline** to load the new tools

### Option 2: Manual Configuration

Add this server configuration to your Cline MCP settings:
- **Server Name**: `robot-team`
- **Command**: `node`
- **Args**: `["C:/Projects/robot-team/MCP/robot-team-server/robot-team-server/build/index.js"]`
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `ROBOT_TEAM_API_KEY`: `rtk_6f9ec826eb6d4085864648a6d58dce2a`
  - `ROBOT_TEAM_API_URL`: `http://localhost:9000`

## 🧪 Test Your Setup

Once configured, test with these commands in Cline:

1. **"What's the status of all the robots?"**
2. **"Send a message through Robot 1 saying 'Hello from the MCP server!'"**
3. **"Schedule Robot 2 to send a reminder in 5 minutes"**

## 🛠️ Available Tools

After setup, Cline will have these Robot Team tools:

1. **send_robot_message** - Send immediate messages through any robot
2. **schedule_robot_message** - Schedule one-time or recurring messages
3. **get_robot_status** - Check robot health and status
4. **list_scheduled_messages** - View scheduled posts
5. **cancel_scheduled_message** - Cancel scheduled messages
6. **generate_api_key** - Create new API keys (admin only)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If tools don't appear in Cline:
1. Check the file path in the configuration is correct
2. Restart VS Code completely
3. Verify the MCP configuration syntax is valid JSON

### If you get authentication errors:
1. Ensure the Robot Team server is running (`npm start`)
2. Check the API key hasn't expired
3. Verify the API URL is correct

## 🎯 Example Usage

Ask Cline things like:
- "Send an announcement through Robot 3 with the title 'Server Update' and content 'Maintenance complete!'"
- "Schedule Robot 5 to post a daily standup reminder every weekday at 9 AM"
- "Show me all scheduled messages for Robot 2"
- "What's the current status of Robot 7?"

## 🔐 Security Notes

- Your API key expires in 90 days
- Store it securely and don't commit to version control
- Generate new keys as needed using the `generate_api_key` tool
- Monitor usage through the Robot Team interface
